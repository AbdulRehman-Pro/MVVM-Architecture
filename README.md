# MVVM-Architecture
MVVM - Model-View-ViewModel architecture , In Android, MVC refers to the default pattern where an Activity acts as a controller and XML files are views. MVVM treats both Activity classes and XML files as views, and ViewModel classes are where you write your business logic. It completely separates an app's UI from its logic.
